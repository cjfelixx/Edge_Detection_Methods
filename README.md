# Edge Detection Methods

This is a computer project on basic Edge Detection algorithms for Digital Image Processing Class EE 416. This project is to develop an understanding of basic edge detections methods using our background knowledge in programming, and signal/image processing.

## Methods Used
* Simple Gradient Edge Detector
* Gradient Edge Detector using 2D filter
	* Roberts
	* Prewitt
	* Sobel
	* Kirch
* Canny Edge Detector

Note: Codes that are provided can be improved to reduce computational time using advanced techniques.
